            <h3>Urbanisation and Economic Growth</h3>
                <p>Cities are huge drivers of economic growth. They host a large share of the population, institutions and most importantly the Infrastructure. However, beyond population or territorial size that drives growth, it is economic weight, proximity to zones of growth and development, political stability, and attractiveness for foreign capital, which are the key drivers of an economy. In other words, connectivity matters more than size, and cities form important regional nodes. Cities thus deserve more nuanced understanding. NIUA is committed to studying in depth the macro parameters that influence urban development and its spatial expansion, with a continual review and analysis of the linkages between urbanisation, migration, urban infrastructure and economic growth.</p>

            <h3>Urban Infrastructure and Built Environment</h3>
                <p>Indian cities are exciting places albeit struggling with a plethora of issues like unsustainable urban form, sub-optimal use of land, congested roads, acute housing shortages being met within unauthorized colonies and slums, degraded built environment, neglected heritage, inequitable access to basic services, and extreme exploitation of natural resources. NIUA provides the knowledge and expertise towards overall strategic and sustainable planning and management of urban areas as well as sectoral focus on areas like heritage management, TOD, inclusive urban planning and design responding to needs of all age groups, genders, abilities, and economic backgrounds. NIUA recognizes that well-managed built environments are a powerful tool to deliver high quality of life to all urban residents by leveraging the historical, ecological and cultural layers that make our cities so interesting.</p>

                <p>NIUA strives towards effectively managing the knowledge generated through various projects, providing faster and more effective access to relevant internal and external knowledge to maximize the impact. To ensure that all the knowledge developed at NIUA is readily available for its users, platforms such as SmartNet help peer-to-peer learning for city agencies and focuses on creating a knowledge sharing ecosystem that increases connectivity internally and among key stakeholders, partners and institutions.</p>

            <h3>Environment, Climate Change & Resilience</h3>
            <p>Sustainable Development Goal 11 directs nations to make their cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. Mainstreaming resilience into urban development is a global agenda. In India, the increasing pace of urbanization and associated challenges are aggravating the vulnerability of cities to shocks and stresses associated with climate change and disasters. Considering this, NIUA is working towards embedding resilience at the heart of urban discourse. As an institute, working on cities of tomorrow, it understands that urban policies and decisions taken today will have direct impacts on a city’s resilience and capacity to respond to these challenges in future. NIUA is working towards building resilience through the lenses of climate smart cities, resilient infrastructure, urban river system management and capacity building on ecosystem services.</p>

            <h3>Urban Governance & Finance</h3>
                <p>Urban governance and finance play a critical role in shaping the physical and social character of urban regions; influence the quantity and quality of local services; determine the sharing of costs and distribution of resources among different groups; affect residents’ ability to engage in decision-making and influence local government accountability. NIUA as an urban policy think tank has actively provided wide-ranging technical assistance to MoHUA, states and ULBs on municipal finance and governance including pan-India mission-mode capacity building for reform adoption with a 4000 ULBs outreach; evaluating municipal health and performance of over 2000 ULBs; and direct hand-holding of a city agency for building its capacities to respond effectively to changing needs and emerging trends.</p>

            <h3>Social Development</h3>
                <p>Social inclusion is a crucial dimension that enables the creation of a dynamic and adaptable framework for city planning and governance. Governance paradigm, that promotes local democracy, participation and inclusion, transparency and accountability, with a view to ensuring sustainable urbanization and spatial quality are the key indicators of social development. Today, big Data, GIS and related computing and database technologies are being looked as enablers to tabulate and analyse data at more precise levels of spatial resolution and improving our ability to accurately predict and manage needs, identifying context-based issues and solutions and designing emergency response systems and quick recovery techniques for cities. In line with the technological revolution influencing social development in urban India, NIUA has been working towards promoting and building knowledge through its various initiatives for Inclusive Cities. It has also been involved in providing technical advisory support for Ease of Doing Business under AMRUT and fostering sustainable, innovative and participatory approaches to develop projects within the Smart City Mission through CITIIS program.</p>
